<h1>Raisin Cupcake</h1>
<p>Raisin cake is typically prepared using standard cake ingredients and raisins as a primary ingredient. Whole or chopped raisins can be used.
Additional various ingredients are also sometimes used, such as rum, chocolate, and others.
The use of rum can serve to plump-up the raisins via the added moisture,and the raisins can be marinated in rum before the cake is prepared.
Spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and pumpkin spice are sometimes used.</p>
